Hello This is a text file.
This is the second line. 
Added third line. 

Three areas
- working dire. - 
- staging - the files which are ready for commit. 
- commit - update the files into repository.


Commit - you are chaging files inside the project. 
Git stores
Your email ID, your name, and why did you commit, what did you commit. 
Unique ID to this information. - Commit ID.

Subhojit wants Git to ignore those files.
